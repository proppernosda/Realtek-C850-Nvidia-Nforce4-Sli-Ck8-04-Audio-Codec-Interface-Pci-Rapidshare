### Method 1: Download and Install the Latest Audio Driver from Realtek or nVIDIA
     
The first method is to manually download and install the latest audio driver from the official website of Realtek or nVIDIA. Here are the steps:

3. Run the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
4. Alternatively, you can go to the [nVIDIA website] and click on "Drivers" at the top menu.
